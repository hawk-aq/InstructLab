What is quantum in computing?

Quantum computing uses the nature of subatomic particles to perform calculations instead of using electrical signals as in classical computing.
Quantum computers use qubits instead of binary bits. 
By programming the initial conditions of the qubit, quantum computing can solve a problem when the superposition state collapses. 
The forefront of quantum computer research is in linking greater numbers of qubits together to be able to solve larger and more complex problems.
